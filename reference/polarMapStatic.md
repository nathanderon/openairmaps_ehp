# Bivariate polar plots on a static ggmap

`polarMapStatic()` creates a `ggplot2` map using bivariate polar plots
as markers. As this function returns a `ggplot2` object, further
customisation can be achieved using functions like
[`ggplot2::theme()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)
and
[`ggplot2::guides()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guides.html).

## Usage

``` r
polarMapStatic(
  data,
  pollutant = NULL,
  ggmap,
  x = "ws",
  limits = "free",
  upper = "fixed",
  latitude = NULL,
  longitude = NULL,
  facet = NULL,
  cols = "turbo",
  alpha = 1,
  key = FALSE,
  facet.nrow = NULL,
  d.icon = 150,
  d.fig = 3,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame. The data frame must contain the data to plot the
  directional analysis marker, which includes wind speed (`ws`), wind
  direction (`wd`), and the column representing the concentration of a
  pollutant. In addition, `data` must include a decimal latitude and
  longitude.

- pollutant:

  The column name(s) of the pollutant(s) to plot. If multiple pollutants
  are specified, they will each form part of a separate panel.

- ggmap:

  A `ggmap` object obtained using
  [`ggmap::get_map()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/ggmap/man/get_map.html) or a
  similar function to use as the basemap.

- x:

  The radial axis variable to plot.

- limits:

  One of:

  - `"fixed"` which ensures all of the markers use the same colour
    scale.

  - `"free"` (the default) which allows all of the markers to use
    different colour scales.

  - A numeric vector in the form `c(lower, upper)` used to define the
    colour scale. For example, `limits = c(0, 100)` would force the plot
    limits to span 0-100.

- upper:

  One of:

  - `"fixed"` (the default) which ensures all of the markers use the
    same radial axis scale.

  - `"free"` which allows all of the markers to use different radial
    axis scales.

  - A numeric value, used as the upper limit for the radial axis scale.

- latitude, longitude:

  The decimal latitude/longitude. If not provided, will be automatically
  inferred from data by looking for a column named "lat"/"latitude" or
  "lon"/"lng"/"long"/"longitude" (case-insensitively).

- facet:

  Used for splitting the input data into different panels, passed to the
  `type` argument of
  [`openair::cutData()`](https://openair-project.github.io/openair/reference/cutData.html).
  `facet` cannot be used if multiple `pollutant` columns have been
  provided.

- cols:

  The colours used for plotting. See
  [`openair::openColours()`](https://openair-project.github.io/openair/reference/openColours.html)
  for more information.

- alpha:

  The alpha transparency to use for the plotting surface (a value
  between 0 and 1 with zero being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque).

- key:

  Should a key for each marker be drawn? Default is `FALSE`.

- facet.nrow:

  Passed to the `nrow` argument of
  [`ggplot2::facet_wrap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html).

- d.icon:

  The diameter of the plot on the map in pixels. This will affect the
  size of the individual polar markers. Alternatively, a vector in the
  form `c(width, height)` can be provided if a non-circular marker is
  desired.

- d.fig:

  The diameter of the plots to be produced using `openair` in inches.
  This will affect the resolution of the markers on the map.
  Alternatively, a vector in the form `c(width, height)` can be provided
  if a non-circular marker is desired.

- ...:

  Arguments passed on to
  [`openair::polarPlot`](https://openair-project.github.io/openair/reference/polarPlot.html)

  `wd`

  :   Name of wind direction field.

  `statistic`

  :   The statistic that should be applied to each wind speed/direction
      bin. Because of the smoothing involved, the colour scale for some
      of these statistics is only to provide an indication of overall
      pattern and should not be interpreted in concentration units e.g.
      for `statistic = "weighted.mean"` where the bin mean is multiplied
      by the bin frequency and divided by the total frequency. In many
      cases using `polarFreq` will be better. Setting
      `statistic = "weighted.mean"` can be useful because it provides an
      indication of the concentration \* frequency of occurrence and
      will highlight the wind speed/direction conditions that dominate
      the overall mean.Can be:

      - “mean” (default), “median”, “max” (maximum), “frequency”.
        “stdev” (standard deviation), “weighted.mean”.

      - `statistic = "nwr"` Implements the Non-parametric Wind
        Regression approach of Henry et al. (2009) that uses kernel
        smoothers. The `openair` implementation is not identical because
        Gaussian kernels are used for both wind direction and speed. The
        smoothing is controlled by `ws_spread` and `wd_spread`.

      - `statistic = "cpf"` the conditional probability function (CPF)
        is plotted and a single (usually high) percentile level is
        supplied. The CPF is defined as CPF = my/ny, where my is the
        number of samples in the y bin (by default a wind direction,
        wind speed interval) with mixing ratios greater than the
        *overall* percentile concentration, and ny is the total number
        of samples in the same wind sector (see Ashbaugh et al., 1985).
        Note that percentile intervals can also be considered; see
        `percentile` for details.

      - When `statistic = "r"` or `statistic = "Pearson"`, the Pearson
        correlation coefficient is calculated for *two* pollutants. The
        calculation involves a weighted Pearson correlation coefficient,
        which is weighted by Gaussian kernels for wind direction an the
        radial variable (by default wind speed). More weight is assigned
        to values close to a wind speed-direction interval. Kernel
        weighting is used to ensure that all data are used rather than
        relying on the potentially small number of values in a wind
        speed-direction interval.

      - When `statistic = "Spearman"`, the Spearman correlation
        coefficient is calculated for *two* pollutants. The calculation
        involves a weighted Spearman correlation coefficient, which is
        weighted by Gaussian kernels for wind direction an the radial
        variable (by default wind speed). More weight is assigned to
        values close to a wind speed-direction interval. Kernel
        weighting is used to ensure that all data are used rather than
        relying on the potentially small number of values in a wind
        speed-direction interval.

      - `"robust_slope"` is another option for pair-wise statistics and
        `"quantile.slope"`, which uses quantile regression to estimate
        the slope for a particular quantile level (see also `tau` for
        setting the quantile level).

      - `"york_slope"` is another option for pair-wise statistics which
        uses the *York regression method* to estimate the slope. In this
        method the uncertainties in `x` and `y` are used in the
        determination of the slope. The uncertainties are provided by
        `x_error` and `y_error` — see below.

  `exclude.missing`

  :   Setting this option to `TRUE` (the default) removes points from
      the plot that are too far from the original data. The smoothing
      routines will produce predictions at points where no data exist
      i.e. they predict. By removing the points too far from the
      original data produces a plot where it is clear where the original
      data lie. If set to `FALSE` missing data will be interpolated.

  `uncertainty`

  :   Should the uncertainty in the calculated surface be shown? If
      `TRUE` three plots are produced on the same scale showing the
      predicted surface together with the estimated lower and upper
      uncertainties at the 95% confidence interval. Calculating the
      uncertainties is useful to understand whether features are real or
      not. For example, at high wind speeds where there are few data
      there is greater uncertainty over the predicted values. The
      uncertainties are calculated using the GAM and weighting is done
      by the frequency of measurements in each wind speed-direction bin.
      Note that if uncertainties are calculated then the type is set to
      "default".

  `percentile`

  :   If `statistic = "percentile"` then `percentile` is used, expressed
      from 0 to 100. Note that the percentile value is calculated in the
      wind speed, wind direction ‘bins’. For this reason it can also be
      useful to set `min.bin` to ensure there are a sufficient number of
      points available to estimate a percentile. See `quantile` for more
      details of how percentiles are calculated.

      `percentile` is also used for the Conditional Probability Function
      (CPF) plots. `percentile` can be of length two, in which case the
      percentile *interval* is considered for use with CPF. For example,
      `percentile = c(90, 100)` will plot the CPF for concentrations
      between the 90 and 100th percentiles. Percentile intervals can be
      useful for identifying specific sources. In addition, `percentile`
      can also be of length 3. The third value is the ‘trim’ value to be
      applied. When calculating percentile intervals many can cover very
      low values where there is no useful information. The trim value
      ensures that values greater than or equal to the trim \* mean
      value are considered *before* the percentile intervals are
      calculated. The effect is to extract more detail from many source
      signatures. See the manual for examples. Finally, if the trim
      value is less than zero the percentile range is interpreted as
      absolute concentration values and subsetting is carried out
      directly.

  `weights`

  :   At the edges of the plot there may only be a few data points in
      each wind speed-direction interval, which could in some situations
      distort the plot if the concentrations are high. `weights` applies
      a weighting to reduce their influence. For example and by default
      if only a single data point exists then the weighting factor is
      0.25 and for two points 0.5. To not apply any weighting and use
      the data as is, use `weights = c(1, 1, 1)`.

      An alternative to down-weighting these points they can be removed
      altogether using `min.bin`.

  `min.bin`

  :   The minimum number of points allowed in a wind speed/wind
      direction bin. The default is 1. A value of two requires at least
      2 valid records in each bin an so on; bins with less than 2 valid
      records are set to NA. Care should be taken when using a value \>
      1 because of the risk of removing real data points. It is
      recommended to consider your data with care. Also, the `polarFreq`
      function can be of use in such circumstances.

  `mis.col`

  :   When `min.bin` is \> 1 it can be useful to show where data are
      removed on the plots. This is done by shading the missing data in
      `mis.col`. To not highlight missing data when `min.bin` \> 1
      choose `mis.col = "transparent"`.

  `angle.scale`

  :   Sometimes the placement of the scale may interfere with an
      interesting feature. The user can therefore set `angle.scale` to
      any value between 0 and 360 degrees to mitigate such problems. For
      example `angle.scale = 45` will draw the scale heading in a NE
      direction.

  `units`

  :   The units shown on the polar axis scale.

  `force.positive`

  :   The default is `TRUE`. Sometimes if smoothing data with steep
      gradients it is possible for predicted values to be negative.
      `force.positive = TRUE` ensures that predictions remain positive.
      This is useful for several reasons. First, with lots of missing
      data more interpolation is needed and this can result in artefacts
      because the predictions are too far from the original data.
      Second, if it is known beforehand that the data are all positive,
      then this option carries that assumption through to the
      prediction. The only likely time where setting
      `force.positive = FALSE` would be if background concentrations
      were first subtracted resulting in data that is legitimately
      negative. For the vast majority of situations it is expected that
      the user will not need to alter the default option.

  `k`

  :   This is the smoothing parameter used by the `gam` function in
      package `mgcv`. Typically, value of around 100 (the default) seems
      to be suitable and will resolve important features in the plot.
      The most appropriate choice of `k` is problem-dependent; but
      extensive testing of polar plots for many different problems
      suggests a value of `k` of about 100 is suitable. Setting `k` to
      higher values will not tend to affect the surface predictions by
      much but will add to the computation time. Lower values of `k`
      will increase smoothing. Sometimes with few data to plot
      `polarPlot` will fail. Under these circumstances it can be worth
      lowering the value of `k`.

  `normalise`

  :   If `TRUE` concentrations are normalised by dividing by their mean
      value. This is done *after* fitting the smooth surface. This
      option is particularly useful if one is interested in the patterns
      of concentrations for several pollutants on different scales e.g.
      NOx and CO. Often useful if more than one `pollutant` is chosen.

  `key.header`

  :   Adds additional text/labels to the scale key. For example, passing
      the options `key.header = "header", key.footer = "footer1"` adds
      addition text above and below the scale key. These arguments are
      passed to `drawOpenKey` via `quickText`, applying the `auto.text`
      argument, to handle formatting.

  `key.footer`

  :   see `key.footer`.

  `key.position`

  :   Location where the scale key is to plotted. Allowed arguments
      currently include `"top"`, `"right"`, `"bottom"` and `"left"`.

  `auto.text`

  :   Either `TRUE` (default) or `FALSE`. If `TRUE` titles and axis
      labels will automatically try and format pollutant names and units
      properly e.g. by subscripting the \`2' in NO2.

  `ws_spread`

  :   The value of sigma used for Gaussian kernel weighting of wind
      speed when `statistic = "nwr"` or when correlation and regression
      statistics are used such as *r*. Default is `0.5`.

  `wd_spread`

  :   The value of sigma used for Gaussian kernel weighting of wind
      direction when `statistic = "nwr"` or when correlation and
      regression statistics are used such as *r*. Default is `4`.

  `x_error`

  :   The `x` error / uncertainty used when `statistic = "york_slope"`.

  `y_error`

  :   The `y` error / uncertainty used when `statistic = "york_slope"`.

  `kernel`

  :   Type of kernel used for the weighting procedure for when
      correlation or regression techniques are used. Only `"gaussian"`
      is supported but this may be enhanced in the future.

  `formula.label`

  :   When pair-wise statistics such as regression slopes are calculated
      and plotted, should a formula label be displayed?

  `tau`

  :   The quantile to be estimated when `statistic` is set to
      `"quantile.slope"`. Default is `0.5` which is equal to the median
      and will be ignored if `"quantile.slope"` is not used.

## Value

a `ggplot2` plot with a `ggmap` basemap

## Further customisation using ggplot2

As the outputs of the static directional analysis functions are
`ggplot2` figures, further customisation is possible using functions
such as
[`ggplot2::theme()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html),
[`ggplot2::guides()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guides.html)
and
[`ggplot2::labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html).

If multiple pollutants are specified, subscripting (e.g., the "x" in
"NOx") is achieved using the
[ggtext](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/reference/ggtext.html) package.
Therefore if you choose to override the plot theme, it is recommended to
use `[ggplot2::theme()]` and `[ggtext::element_markdown()]` to define
the `strip.text` parameter.

When arguments like `limits`, `percentile` or `breaks` are defined, a
legend is automatically added to the figure. Legends can be removed
using `ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "none")`, or further customised
using
[`ggplot2::guides()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guides.html)
and either `color = ggplot2::guide_colourbar()` for continuous legends
or `fill = ggplot2::guide_legend()` for discrete legends.
